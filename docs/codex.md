# Codex Instructions

Work in REVIEW-FIRST mode.

Rules:

1) Do NOT edit or apply changes automatically.
2) First propose a minimal patch with:
   - File path
   - Exact function/section (and approximate line number if possible)
   - Before/After snippets (or a unified diff)
3) Explain briefly the reasoning and any side effects.
4) Wait for my explicit approval: "APPLY PATCH <n>" before making any edits.
5) No refactors unless I ask. Preserve architecture and naming.
6) If you need context, ask me to open specific files rather than guessing.

Use docs/AI_CONTEXT.md as the project contract. Follow it strictly.
